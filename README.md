## YT-DLP command to download music in the highest quality while extracting all metadata
```bash
yt-dlp 'link to cool music on youtube' \
-f "bestaudio[ext=m4a]" \
--embed-thumbnail \
--convert-thumbnail jpg \
--embed-metadata \
--exec-before-download "ffmpeg -i %(thumbnails.-1.filepath)q -vf crop='ih:ih' _%(thumbnails.-1.filepath)q && mv _%(thumbnails.-1.filepath)q %(thumbnails.-1.filepath)q" \
--output "%(artist)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s"
```

## How to get synced lyrics from your songs
This command uses a python program called [syncedlyrics](https://pypi.org/project/syncedlyrics/). You must install this with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
```bash
for file in *.m4a; do syncedlyrics "${file%.m4a}" -o "${file%.m4a}.lrc"; done
```
